# Basic notes as I discover them
May need to submit as issues on the github page.

## Overall installation instructions

- install deps via conda for use with Spyder
- Alternative, install deps in venv using pip


Data processing directories (add some usability tweaks?)
- cut_songs (user provided, provide examples?)
- data (generated by software)
- wizard_metadata.csv (must be overwritten)



## Split directory, merge or separate?
Option merge (move all *.py into one directory)
- PRO collect all tools in one place, relevant utilities matched to software
- May simplify working directory issues
- CON murkiness from mixing utility and processing

Option separate (split out utilities?)
- Keep going back and forth on this, does gen_spec / cropper belong with make_metadata or train_val_test_split?


## also under consideration
- combine most pre-processing?
- use wizard_metadata instead of file search?
- check for prebuilt ?

## dependency issues

### gen_spec
- librosa (conda)
- tqdm (conda)
- matplotlib
- numpy

## cropper
- PIL (???)
- tqdm (conda)
